Name: The Forlorn Steampunk Catapult-Knight
Chapter: 1

It is a warm summer morning and you are moping around the Victorian-esque house of your parents, Kale and Juniper Halberson, standing in the kitchen with the door to the ice-box open in front of you when your father walks in.

"Don't let all the cold out of there or you'll be hauling a fresh block of ice in from the market," he says. "By hand. The steam-cart is at the smithy for a tune-up."

"Yeah, yeah," you pout, dropping the lid.

"What's wrong, my son? Why are you so forlorn this morn? You're competing in the big catapult-knight tournament this week!"

"Dad!" you cry in exasperation. "You know I don't have a proper cata-horse - we had to sell it last season when we lost all our pigs to that virus. I don't stand a chance!"

"Oh right," he mumbles, rubbing the stubble on his chin. "That virus came in a flash - right through all the windows. The windows of the barn I mean." Your father sighs and gets a faraway look in his eyes. "In my day, we used a live horse to pull a real catapult."

"Oh, not this again," you say. "That's so not steampunk. Also it's not cool to endanger horses like that any more."

"Curses, I wager I shouldn't have made that wager. What did I go and put money on you for? We'd better go into town and buy you a new cata-horse."

"One that runs on steam?" you ask, your spirits lifting.

"Yes, a steam cata-horse, even."

When you reach the heart of the cata-horse district, you spend several hours perusing all the find and knight-worthy steam-powered death machines. You eventually settle on two models, but you're having a hard time deciding which to go with. Well, it's now or never.
